Need to connect S3, Flume, Airflow and a Lambda function? Got a batch process that runs too long or fails often? Maybe you're less technical but you're sick of hearing that some job failed so you can't run the report you need.

Get in contact to start with a free session. Spend half an hour explaining the objective and constraints and you'll get a report outlining some high level, solution agnostic approaches to consider.

Alternately, if you've already got a high level plan, consider whether the sensitivity or volume of data warrants a closer look before you're too far committed down a potentially expensive or costly route.
