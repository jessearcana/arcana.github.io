Leveraging large language models as part of a broader solution requires an understanding of the likely costs, strengths, data privacy and user experience. Apex Arcana have built up experience in natural language processing in general, and with OpenAI and other API or self-hosted models. Integrating these into a semantic system and understanding the right configuration are crucial to the success of any LLM project.

For many structured data predictive applications, statistical or machine learned models are still a viable approach and Apex Arcana have the expertise to scope and deliver a project suitable for your data and business applications.
