If you're working on new features or capabilities you might have an unacceptable level of uncertainty around delivery or likelihood of success. Bring in a lateral thinker with a track record of seeing the critical flaws and identifying elegent solutions. Failing to acknowledge risk when you're embarking on a major project is obviously problematic, but remember that often the team working on your next generation solution has most of their real world experience tied up in your existing solution stack. The overall direction might be fine but you may be able to avoid a whole lot of re-work if you get the right advice early on.

Get in contact to start with a free session. Spend half an hour explaining the objective and constraints and you'll get a report outlining some high level, solution agnostic approaches to consider.

Alternately, if you've already got a high level plan, consider whether the sensitivity or volume of data warrants a closer look before you're too far committed down a potentially expensive or costly route.
