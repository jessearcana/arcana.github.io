Before committing to a new system or service, get an experienced professional to map out how things should fit together and identify any problem areas. Getting someone independent of cloud platforms and big platform providers could save you a lot down the track.

Get in contact to start with a free session. Spend half an hour explaining the objective and constraints and you'll get a report outlining some high level, solution agnostic approaches to consider.

Alternately, if you've already got a high level plan, consider whether the sensitivity or volume of data warrants a closer look before you're too far committed down a potentially expensive or costly route.
